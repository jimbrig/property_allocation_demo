## Property Allocation Application <img src='img/logo.png' align="right" height="35" />

***

**Welcome to the Property Allocation R Shiny Application!**

This dynamic application brings simplicity to the complex realm of risk allocation for Property Insurance. It allows users to test various allocation procedures 
and methodologies in real time with real data.  

*Please review the below information before proceeding to the application.*

## About this Project

This project is setup as an R Package to aid developers by creating an infrastructure 
meant for collaboration, reproducibility, transparency, and thorough testing and 
documentation. Additionally, all dependencies are stored within the package 
making it portable, environment independent, and properly managed for distribution.  

To see the main documentation site click on the **Documentation** action link in the 
sidebar and the package will automatically launch it locally for you.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a model in R Shiny that allocates an 
insured’s prospective year property insurance costs in an equitable, easily 
understood manner that saves the client time, provides the option to use an 
“actuarial” methodology, while still allowing for maximum flexibility and edits.

## Installation

**propalloc** is setup as an R Package making it simple to house all the various
dependencies that the final application relies on.

Make sure you have the latest and stable version of [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

### BitBucket

Install from [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_bitbucket("owac/property-allocation-shiny-app",
                            "<username>", 
                            "<password>")
```

For example, if your username is `john.doe@tychobra.com` and your
password is `password123` you’ll run this code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_bitbucket(
  "owac/property-allocation-shiny-app", 
  auth_user = "john.doe@tychobra.com", 
  password = "password123"
)
```

Your bitbucket password may be different than your windows password.
Your username is probably your Oliver Wyman email address.

### GitHub

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com) via:

For information on setting up your GitHub PAT (Personal Access Token) visit 
[this webpage](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)

# using username/password
devtools::install_github("jimbrig2011/propalloc",
                         "<username>", 
                         "<password>")

# using GitHub PAT
# library(usethis)
# usethis::browse_github_pat()

devtools::install_github("jimbrig2011/propalloc",
                         auth_token = github_pat(quiet))
```

to make sure you have read access to the repository and for further troubleshooting.

## Demo

To demo the app, simply install the package and run the code below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
propalloc::run_app()
```

*Note that the run_app function will automatically install package dependencies for you.*

## Technical

This project is set up as an R Package.

It also utilized GIT LFS. To install run **git lfs install** in git bash.

## Scope of Services

Upon completion, this model will be used as a demo to sell future work, similar
to the R Shiny casualty cost allocation model. Once sold, this model will provide
a template for billable projects.

Specifically, the property allocation model will allocate the premium, taxes,
fees, surcharges and any related costs (collectively, the “property insurance costs”)
to the desired level. This level can include up to six hierarchies (e.g. Country,
Business Unit, Division, Region, Location, and Intra-location Department). 

The tool will enable the client to incorporate the following criteria into its
allocation process:

- Total Insured Value (TIV)
- Market AOP Rates (provided by Marsh or Client)
- Market CAT Rates
+ Wind Tier
+ Earthquake Exposure
+ Flood Exposure
- Terrorism Rates
- Claim Frequency
- Claim Severity
- Risk Engineering Credits/Surcharges
- Other Manual Adjustments
- Relativity Adjustments
+ Combustible vs. Non-Combustible
+ Sprinkler Type/Status
+ Business Unit (BU)

In addition, the model will allow a client to select various thresholds and 
caps on premium/rate changes.

The tool will also provide multiple summaries, facilitating the comparison of 
the resulting allocation in up to three different scenarios. For example, 
the client can compare the resulting to allocation based upon: proposed market 
rates without adjustment, rates used in the prior year allocation, proposed
increases for budget guidance applied to the rates used in the prior year.

The tool will also give the user the ability to:

- Edit the TIV, properties, or other aspects of the exposures in the 
statement of values (SOV) between the scenarios outlined above
(this is of importance as information often changes throughout the allocation process)
- Force the final allocation for a specific or a set of specific locations to be a fixed number
- Change the different loss severity buckets considered in the model
- Add extra fees after the allocation is complete, while still maintaining the 
allocation of the other property insurance costs

Lastly, the tool will provide a summary by any combination of the six hierarchies
that will calculate the dollar change in premium attributable to any of the following:

- change in TIV,
- change in the initial implied rates,
- claims charges,
- manual “all other risk” adjustment, and/or
- cap placed on the increase in rate and the resulting off-balance associated with a cap.
